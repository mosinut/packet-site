      <description>For a number of years I have run FreeNAS has a home storage appliance to do all the things that you do with storage at home.

      <description>My goal for this blog is to collect together the notes and scraps I&amp;rsquo;ve collected in one spot so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to find them again. This would save me both time and keystrokes searching around to find how to do X yet again. I also would like to include some of the technical things I have found both professionally and personally that have brought a moment to joy to the day.</description>
