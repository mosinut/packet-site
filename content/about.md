# Howdy Folks

Thank you for visiting. I'm Mark Greenlaw and this is my blog and online notebook.

I use this site to record various technical discoveries, record solutions to problems I don't want to forget, and the occasional personal topic.

## Professional Information

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create
the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!
