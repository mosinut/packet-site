My goal for this blog is to collect together the notes and scraps I've collected in one spot so I don't have to find them again. This would save me both time and keystrokes searching around to find how to do X *yet again*. I also would like to include some of the technical things I have found both professionally and personally that have brought a moment to joy to the day.

I'm going to slowly move over things from my old archived notes and proto-blog.

My main interests that I may cover include:
 - Networking
 - Computer and Network Security
 - Cloud Computing
 - Containers
 - Automation
 - Programming
 - Radios
